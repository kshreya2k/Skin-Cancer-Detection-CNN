# Skin-Cancer-Detection-CNN-
An academic group project for Machine Learning Final Project. In this project, skin cancer images are preprocessed and a sequential convolution neural network (CNN) was developed to identify the type of cancer. The primary objective is to accurately classify skin cancer types from images using Tensorflow and Keras.
